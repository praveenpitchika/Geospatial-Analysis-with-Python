# Python Foundation for Spatial Analysis

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that serve as a foundational guide for performing geospatial analysis and data visualization using Python. The notebooks are designed for students or professionals who want to apply programming skills to geospatial data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need to set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries.

### Prerequisites

You should have Python 3.8 or a newer version installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/praveenpitchika/Geospatial-Analysis-with-Python/tree/main
    cd Geospatial-Analysis-with-Python
    ```
    
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    The notebooks rely on several key libraries for geospatial data handling, manipulation, and visualization. You can install them all using `pip`.
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter numpy pandas geopandas matplotlib seaborn contextily rasterio
    ```

## üìö Notebooks

### 1. Python Foundation for Spatial Analysis.ipynb

This notebook introduces the fundamental concepts and tools for working with spatial data in Python.

* **Key Topics Covered:**
    * **Introduction to GeoPandas:** The core library for handling geospatial data in Python, similar to how Pandas handles tabular data.
    * **Reading and Writing Spatial Data:** Loading common file formats like Shapefiles (`.shp`), GeoJSON (`.geojson`), and other vector data.
    * **Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS):** Understanding, defining, and reprojecting data to different coordinate systems.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Performing geometric operations, spatial joins, and filtering data.
    * **Data Aggregation:** Grouping spatial data to create meaningful summaries.

### 2. Mapping and Data Visualization.ipynb

This notebook focuses on the visualization of geospatial data, transforming raw data into informative maps and charts.

* **Key Topics Covered:**
    * **Static Mapping with Matplotlib and GeoPandas:** Creating basic maps, choropleth maps, and thematic maps.
    * **Adding Context:** Using libraries like `contextily` to add base maps from sources like OpenStreetMap to provide geographic context.
    * **Interactive Visualization:** An introduction to libraries like `folium` for creating interactive web maps directly from Python.
    * **Creating Custom Visualizations:** Using `seaborn` and other plotting libraries to visualize non-spatial attributes of your geospatial data.
    * **Exporting Maps:** Saving your visualizations in various formats (`.png`, `.svg`, etc.).
